This project is the CS50 certification final project.

### The Project Idea

For this project, I decided to build a `Job Analyser` website tool that helps people to know more about several job roles and make the right decision for their future dream job.

### Methodology

I started by collecting the data needed by building a web scraper using BeautifulSoup and API requests to fetch the job listing information from a website called [GOV.UK](gov.uk).
The next step was to clean and transform the data to ensure that the data is reliable and ready for analysis.
Finaly, I builed a dashboard-like website using Flask framework and Sqlite to present the data using interactive visualization.
