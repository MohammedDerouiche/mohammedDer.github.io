## Project Overview


This analysis delves into the operations and performance metrics of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company based in Chicago. Leveraging data from the years 2020 to 2023, the project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations to optimize business strategies and enhance customer experience. By exploring various facets such as user behavior, bike usage patterns, and seasonal trends, the analysis seeks to uncover key drivers of success and opportunities for growth.

## Methodology

The analysis primarily utilizes the R programming language, along with popular libraries such as ggplot2 and tidyverse. Data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation techniques are applied to ensure the reliability and accuracy of insights derived from the datasets. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including visualization and statistical analysis, are utilized to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
